# movie-watchlist

A Scrimba solo project

## Overview
### The challenge

User should have access to:

  - Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html
  - The index page should have a search input bar which  calls to OMDb API with the title searched for and displays search results.
  - An "add to watchlist" button which saves that data to local storage
  - Watchlist.html should load and display the data saved from local storage.
